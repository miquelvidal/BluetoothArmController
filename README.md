# BluetoothArmController
Bluetooth serial communicator with Bluetooth-enabled Arduino for Controlling a Prosthetic Arm

This android code connects to a bluetooth dongle of Arduino and sends a Binary code depending on the button pressed.
The idea is to have the code to be sent from an input via the Myo Bracelet. That way, we plan to control some servo-motors to cotrol the fingers of a prosthetic arm.
